#### Signal.
Signal is a game jam game made with 8 people for Global Game Jam 2018. It is a point and click adventure game with four puzzles, and a short framing story threaded through the game.
#### Limited Spaceship
The Spaceship is almost out of energy and all actions cost energy, would you be able to stand against the hazards until the level is completed ?
