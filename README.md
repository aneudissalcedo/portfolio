#### Signal.
Signal is a game jam game made with 8 people for Global Game Jam 2018. It is a point and click adventure game with four puzzles, and a short framing story threaded through the game.
#### Limited Spaceship
The Spaceship is almost out of energy and all actions cost energy, would you be able to stand against the hazards until the level is completed ?
#### Escape Maze
Are you brave enough to escape a maze? Then, try out this new exciting game where you need to escape the maze without being spotted from the guardians!
#### Magical Key
In this scene, you should go to the portal and win the game, but to make it happen you would need a golden key. The question is, would you achieve it without falling into the lava?
